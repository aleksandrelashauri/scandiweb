## About The Project
  It's an e-commerce front-end application built with React and Redux. It has product listing page - PLP, product description page -PDP, cart page, and cart overlay.

  A user can can hover over specific products to see the attributes (options) of the those products if such products have options. He/she can add products to cart either from the PLP page using the cart icon or from the PDP page using Add To Cart button. He/she can increment/decrement the quantity of the added products. He/she can also remove specific products from cart entirely using the remove button.

  A user can filter products based on their categories such as tech, clothes. All category render the entire products on the PLP page.

  A user can also exchange currencies using the currency exchanger on the header. Again, the cart icon on the header keeps count of the number of products added to cart.

  This project consumes a third party GraphQL API.
